# InventoryManagementApp

Project Description: Stock Management System

The Stock Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to manage their inventory, monitor transactions, and interact with suppliers. The system provides a user-friendly command-line interface where sellers can perform various tasks related to their stock, such as adding new products from suppliers, updating product details, and deleting products that are no longer needed.

Key Features:

Supplier Management: The system enables owners to manage adding new products to the database or updating the details of existing inventory.

Product Management: Owners can add new products to their inventory, update product details such as price and quantity, and monitor the current stock status of each product. Each product is identified by a unique product ID, and its name, price, and quantity are recorded.

The project utilizes object-oriented programming principles, encapsulation, and file handling to efficiently manage stock-related tasks. It helps owners maintain accurate inventory records, make informed business decisions, and facilitate smooth interactions with suppliers and customers.

Please note that the project is designed as a command-line application, and further improvements and enhancements can be made to extend its functionality and create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) if required.
